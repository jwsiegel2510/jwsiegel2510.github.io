			<p>
				I am currently an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University. Previously I was an Assistant Research Professor in the Mathematics Department at Penn State working with Professor Jinchao Xu.
			</p>
			<p> 
				My research interests are centered around approximation theory and its adjacent fields of mathematics and science, 
				in particular deep learning, statistics, and numerical methods for solving PDEs. 
				I have also worked on numerical optimization, partial differential equations, 
				deep learning and compressed sensing as well as their applications to materials science.
				You can find more details on my research <a href="research.html"><b>here</b></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I received my PhD from UCLA under the direction of Russel Caflisch. Here is my <a href="CV.pdf"><b>CV</b></a>.
